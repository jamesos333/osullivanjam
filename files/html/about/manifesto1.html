            osullivanjam.es is a continuously evolving programming project which
            serves as a home for the personal projects of its creator. The exact
            contents of this website are vast and remain subject to contant
            changes and development.

            The osullivanjam.es website has not yet had its purpose and
            objectives explicitly outlined; I believe it stands to benefit from
            this analysis. In this document we will investigate its broader aims
            and design philosophy.

        <h3>Investigations and Outcomes</h3>
        <p>
            With modern programming, there is an undeniable emphasis on making
            frontend design as functional, easily understandable, and modern as
            possible. This is, of course, generally a good thing. We don't want
            the websites we use to be convoluted or confusing, and there is a
            lot of comfort in being able to pick up most user interfaces
            quickly. I mean, you would not want your banking app to look the way
            that this site does.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I feel as though this emphasis on utility over creativity
            serves to siphon the creativity out of what we do as programmers at
            the behest of maximum functionality. It's not so much a form of free
            self-expression anymore and the creative process becomes imprisoned;
            you can still create appealing designs as long as they remain
            confined to the strict boundaries of design frameworks (such as
            Bootstrap, Material Design, etc.) and also confined to what the
            modern internet user expects and can use easily. Studies on where
            our eyes will look first on a webpage and where advertisements can
            be placed to generate the most clicks aid in web design and are,
            dare I say, too human. But in the process of adapting more and more
            to us, they become less human. Every website tries to become a
            sterile copy of the next, deviating slightly to give us the facade
            of innovation. New websites continuously exist in the shadow of the
            last, and this endless conformity ensures that few risks can be
            taken in design anymore.

        <h3>Design Approach and Implementation</h3>
        <p>
            So, I want to design this site to be anti-human, or at least in
            opposition to how sterile and boring modern user interface
            development has become. I will create a site that is ugly,
            confusing, outdated, but overall a vessel for one individual (me) to
            express themselves and have fun. I don't know how easy it is for
            someone to navigate this site, I don't know if anyone else will get
            enjoyment out of this, but hopefully this site will be as enjoyable
            to navigate as it is for me to design. As I continue to improve my
            skills, I hope that those improvements will be reflected in the
            website. Currently, my development stack is pretty simple and
            consists of PHP, SASS, Apache2, and Ubuntu, but this is subject to
            change whenever I find more interesting/fun things to use.

        <h3>Preliminary Conclusions and Actions</h3>
        <p>
            I'm not saying that all web design should be selfish like this. I
            care what people want to see, and while I am doing this for fun, I
            do care what other people think about it and I want to make it
            enjoyable for others. Simultaneously though, I'm not designing for
            everyone; if the look and style of these pages resonates with you,
            then that is great, but if they don't, that's okay too. Media
            designed for everyone will end up being for no one. I want to style
            these pages in a way that I think is cool and interesting and using
            languages I enjoy playing with. I hope you, dear visitor, can see
            that enjoyment on display here.
